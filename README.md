MicroGridsPy - Student version
========================

### Description

The MicroGridsPy model main objective is to provide an open-source alternative to the problem of sizing and dispatch of energy in micro-grids in isolated places. It’s written in python(pyomo) and use excel and text files as input and output data handling and visualisation.

Main features:

    Optimal sizing of Lion-Ion batteries, diesel generators and PV panels in order to supply a demand with the lowest cost possible.
    Optimal dispatch from different energy sources.
    Calculation of the net present cost of the system for the project lifetime.
    Determination of the LCOE for the optimal system.
